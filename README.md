## DigitalOcean Documentation

DigitalOcean has some of the best documentation that's ever been written. It is extremely thorough, direct, and devoid of pictures.
You should strive to make your documentation like theirs.

As an example, check out their [UFW Essentials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands)

## Install PiHole

- Visit [Pi-hole.net](https://pi-hole.net/)
- Click `Install`
- Copy the `One-Step Automated Install`

````bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net |bash
````

<mark> Note: Downloading anything from the internet and piping it to `bash` is an inherently bad idea. If you wanted to check out the script before running it, simply drop the `| bash` and redirect the result to a file to review the script before executing.
i.e., `curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net > script.sh` </mark>

## Point your Router @ your PiHole

This will be dependent on the device. However, a quick DuckDuckGo search of your router model along with terms like `custom dns server` will likely resolve this.

## Check Your Work

- Add a Domain to your Blocklist
- Attempt to visit that Domain, resolution should fail
- Remove it from your blocklist
